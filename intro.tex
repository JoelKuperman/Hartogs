\section*{Introduction}

Within the real numbers, there exist multiple infinitely decreasing sequences. Consider the following question: for which functions \(f\) does there exist an initial point \(x_0\) such that the sequence defined by \(x_{n+1} = f(x_n)\) is decreasing? Clearly, for some functions (such as logarithms) this is not the case.

This motivates the following question about decreasing sequences of cardinals: in ZFC, it is possible to construct decreasing sequences of cardinals, but it is not possible to do so in such a way that
\[
X_n =_c \mathcal{P}(X_{n+1}),
\]
where $=_c$ denotes that the sets are bijective. This remains true in weaker theories, since the Axiom of Choice is not required.
However, the well-foundedness of the class of cardinals itself is not provable in ZF. In fact, as shown by Jech (\emph{The Axiom of Choice}, Theorem~11.1), it is consistent with ZF that the cardinals form a non-well-founded structure, and moreover, that this failure of well-foundedness may happen in any way.

 In this article we present a proof of the above fact without using the Replacement axiom.
