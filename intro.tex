\section*{Introduction}

Within the real numbers, there exist multiple infinitely decreasing sequences. Consider the following question: for which functions \(f\) does there exist an initial point \(x_0\) such that the sequence defined by \(x_{n+1} = f(x_n)\) is decreasing? Clearly, for some functions (such as logarithms) this is not the case.

This motivates the following question about decreasing sequences of cardinals: in ZFC, it is possible to construct decreasing sequences of cardinals, but it is not possible to do so in such a way that
\[
X_n =_c \mathcal{P}(X_{n+1}),
\]
where $=_c$ denotes that the sets are bijective. This remains true in weaker theories, since the Axiom of Choice is not required. In this article we present a proof of this fact without using the Replacement axiom.
